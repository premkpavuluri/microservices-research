# Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture :

## Difficult to scale:
    Monolithic applications can be difficult to scale, especially as they grow in size and complexity. This is because all of the components in a monolithic application
    share the same resources, such as memory, CPU, and database.

## Hard to optimize any one function:
   Monolithic systems lack the agility and flexibility that many modern businesses require. Because all functions and services are locked into each other, it’s hard to optimize, boost or alter any one function without taking the entire application apart. This isn’t just time and resource-consuming but can also disrupt your continuous delivery.

## Tight code coupling:
   The tight coupling of a monolith means that when one function goes down, they all do. So, if one backend service crashes, the entire app could become unusable until the issue is fixed.

## Testing becomes harder:
   Even a small change can negatively affect the system. As a result, the regression for full monolithic service is required for every small changes.

## The cost of infrastructure:
   In cases of performance issues, you should scale the whole monolithic service. It brings additional cost for application operability.
  
## Lack of flexibility:
   A monolith is constrained by the technologies already used in the monolith. You cannot use other tools even if they are better for the problem at hand. Monolithic applications are not easy to reuse and adapt for new purposes and functions either.

<!-- ## Reliability:
   If there’s an error in any module, it could affect the entire application’s availability. -->
