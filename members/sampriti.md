# Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture :

- Difficult to scale :- Monolithic applications can be difficult to scale, especially as they grow in size and complexity. This is because all of the components in a monolithic application share the same resources, such as memory, CPU, and local-storage. In monolithic architecture it is impossible to scale a single component on it's own. We are forced to allocate extra resources to the entire system.

- Single point of fragility :- A monolithic application has a single point of failure, meaning that if any one component fails, the entire application will fail. This can be a major problem for applications that require high availability.

- Barrier to technology adoption :- A monolith is constrained by the technologies already used in the monolith. You cannot easily introduce new tools even if they are better for the problem at hand.
