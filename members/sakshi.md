## Advantages of monolithic

- Simplicity in development - because all the components of the application are developed and deploy together so developer don't need to deal with complex inter-communication between systems or manage multiple codebase

- Easy to test -  end to end testing is very easy since need to test single app no need to wait for any other services to be up 

- Simple deployment - since code base at the same place no deployment is very easy. there is no dependency of any other service.

- Easy to debug - when bug arises it is very easy to debug because entire application is single process. developer can also check the functional flow easily.

- Easy to onboard new member - In monolithic we will have single codebase. New member can easily debug the functional flow and get familiar with it

- Low cost for initial setup - Since all source code is located at same place for initial setup it won't take much time and cost

- cross-cutting concerns -
