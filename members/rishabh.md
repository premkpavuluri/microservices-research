#### Problems Microservices Solve

the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.

- Allow skill set felxibility (Everyone developing the app doesn't need to be proficient on a single tech stack)
- Developer efficiency (Faster Builds, less commit issues, smaller more managable code base )
- Easy less risky deployment (Less chance of breaking the whole application with a single deployment)

- Managable life cycle (Easier to switch to a better technology)
