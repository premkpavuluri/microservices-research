### Problems microservices solving

- Most powerful benefits of microservices is how they force you to break your problems down into buildable pieces

- Makes the code more maintainable and testable (code is broken based on the functionality and makes it simple to maintain as they are broken and easy to hold context of small pieces)

- They give better scalability (in case of high traffic, rather than upscaling whole monolith we can now simply upscale the service where the traffic would be more)

- Allows developers to develop code in different language per service so they can choose a suitable language for that particular service's functionality
